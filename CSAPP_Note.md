# Computer System a programmer perspective note
## 1 A tour of computer system
### 1.1 All information is bits
In this section, There is an important quotes I wish to remember: **All information, whether stored in disk files, or network contents, is stored as bits.**
### 1.2 Four phases of compilation
* Pre-processor phase: The orginal file is modified the C programs according to the directives i.e. insert them into the file
* Complilation phase: the file contains an assembly language program. Each staetment in an assembly language program describes exatcly one low-level machine language instruction in text form. An assembly language is useful because it provides a comon output language for diferent compilers for different high level language
* Assembly phase: In this phase the file from the previous phase is translated into machine language instructions, packages them into a form known as relocatable object program and store them into a binray file whose bytes encode machine language instructions rather than characters. 
* Linking phase: In this pahse, other functions are precompiled in a separate object file, and which must be merged with the the file from previous phase. The result of merge is called   executable object file that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.
